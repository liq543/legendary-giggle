Proposed Features:

User Registration and Authentication: Using express-session and cookies.

Sound Recording: A feature to record and upload sound snippets.

Guess Mechanism: Users can listen to sounds and input their guesses. The app would provide immediate feedback if the guess was correct or not.

Scoreboard: A leaderboard that ranks players based on correct guesses.

Profile Pages: Where users can view their recorded sounds, scores, and rankings.

Sound Categories: Option for users to select categories for the sounds they record (e.g., nature, musical instruments, daily life, etc.)

Technology Stack:

Backend: Node.js and Express.js (RESTful API)

Frontend Templating: Handlebars.js

Database: MySQL with Sequelize ORM

Authentication: express-session and cookies

Deployment: Heroku

New Technology: Consider integrating a package like multer for handling audio file uploads or Web Audio API for more advanced audio processing.

Project Structure (MVC Paradigm):

Models: User, SoundClip, Scoreboard, Categories

Views: Homepage, Dashboard, Login/Signup, Profile, Game Page, Scoreboard Page

Controllers: UserRoutes, SoundRoutes, ScoreRoutes

Routes:

GET:
/: Landing page.
/dashboard: Main game dashboard.
/login: Login page.
/signup: Signup page.
/profile/:userId: Display user's profile.
/sound/:soundId: Play a specific sound for guessing.
/scoreboard: Display top players.
POST:
/signup: Register a new user.
/login: Authenticate and log in a user.
/sound: Upload a new sound clip.
/guess: Submit a guess for a sound clip.
Security:

Store API keys, connection strings, and any sensitive information using environment variables.

Sanitize user input to protect against SQL injection.

Ensure uploaded sound files are properly validated and sanitized to prevent malicious uploads.

UI/UX:

Polished UI: Use a modern CSS framework like Bootstrap or TailwindCSS.

Responsiveness: Ensure the application looks and functions well on various screen sizes.

Interactivity: Use JavaScript to make the UI responsive to user actions in real-time (e.g., playing sounds, showing immediate feedback on guesses). (edited)

As a bonus goal ( if we somehow have time ) we could add adjective descriptions to the prompts that players could also provide this could be in the form of a bonus round or seperate game mode

I just thought of the prompt being "gay bees" and it made me laugh really hard but maybe thats a bit too cards against humanity

but you get the point could potentially make it funnier
